The game accomplishes almost everything I set out to do. I completed everything I wanted to complete in the game except for the abandoned building. I wanted to make an abandoned building and have a hidden floor, but I didn’t have enough time and the code would have taken to long
A time I got stuck was when I was trying to make the bouncer block the night club. The bouncer was letting the player pass him and go into the night club without the correct items. How I got unstuck was talking to Mrs. Kiang. She explained what I was doing wrong and showed me some of the code that would help me figure out how to make the bouncer block the path.
The first puzzle I created is a people puzzle. To solve it you need to examine the dead body. Take the stamp card. Go west to the bakery and talk to the baker. Ask him about the stamp card and then say yes. He will give you a loaf of bread. The bread is one of the items to help you get into the night club. I changed it, you can go east even if you don’t have the bread.
The second puzzle is a sequence puzzle. You examine the bar, then it says there is a shelf, then you examine the shelf, and it says you see something shiny and take it, it is the key.
The third puzzle is a people puzzle. To solve it you have the knife in your inventory and you ask the jeweler about the knife. Then he confesses and you win the game.
A gameplay mechanic I used is the examining function. You need to examine the dead body to find an important item, and you need to examine the shelves to find an important item. This improves user experiences because as a real life detective you would examine the dead body for clues, and that leads you to a suspect. As a detective you would also go to a place and investigate everything for clues.
Noa Kam beta tested my game.
His feedback helped me add more responses to the npc, and he helped catch lots of spelling errors. It also showed me what part of my game might be difficult.
I beta tested Noa Kam’s game
I helped him with his spelling, and I helped him change one of his puzzles because it was to difficult to figure out.
I am most proud of the programing I had to do for the bouncer because I had to figure out how to block the night club entrance. Then let the player in if they gave him two specific items. It took a long time and I only needed a little bit of help from Mrs. Kiang. I problem solved and figured out how to do it mostly by myself.
Next time I want to try making a floor that is unknown unless you do something away from that building. I really wanted to do something like that, but I couldn’t because I didn’t know how to code for it, or even how to begin.
