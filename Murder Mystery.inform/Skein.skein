It's the afternoon and you are an ace detective working on another murder mystery. You have a partner who you can ask some questions about. The body was found dead in the alleyway and you must find out who the killer is. There are many clues to follow and no time to waste so get to work.

Murder Mystery
An Interactive Fiction by Aaron Hirahara
Release 1 / Serial number 170226 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

alleyway
A big alley with gray brick walls on either side. The ground has a lot of cracks in the concrete. This is not the type of place you want to be spending your afternoon. To the south is the sidewalk.

You can see your partner and a dead body here.

Since it is not night, there is no one in the night club at the moment. You see a bar and a row of seats. It is kind of dark in the night club because normally the lights are on. To the north is the night club entrance.

You can see chairs and a bar here.

You take the jeweler down to the precinct to interrogate him. He confesses to the murder of Lisa and says he was just really angry. He murdered her in her room and then dumped the body in the alleyway. He says she didn't know what was best for herself.... Just another day in the life of an ace detective.
